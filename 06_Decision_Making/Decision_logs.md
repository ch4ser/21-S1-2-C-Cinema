|       26/2/2021   |   Admin         |    All: Team formalization and meeting schedule determination    | We introduce ourselves in the first meeting and get familiar with each others. We made an appointment regarding weekly meeting time to ensure that we can push forward the progress of our project efficiently| We team formally took the project we need to focus on and gather each member's attention.| None| Yuchen Wang becames the main person that contacts our client, and we would have online meeting weekly|
|       4/3/2021    |   Communication   |    All, Kai: Confirm meeting time with our client              |  After the team formalization, all members reached a consensus that we need to contact  our client to understand the whole project so that we can arrange our teamwork ASAP. Hence we contacted our client and made an appointment that we would meet him on 9th March.    |    We can communicate with our client face to face so thatWe can grasp our client's requirements better and our client can answer our questions clearly, which is good for our project progress.    |It may occupy the client's time. We may not entirely understand the client's answer.|We emailed our client and made an appointment that we would meet on 9th March. Yuliang Ma, Jiawei Fan and Yuchen Wang would attend that meeting and record our client's thoughts. We will arrange our next working content based on that meeting.|
|       4/3/2021    |   Admin   |    All: Determine topics of client meeting                |  We held a short meeting to decide what content our questions would include. | Kai and we can focus on the most concerned issues at current stage. It can also save our meeting time, which makes our meeting more efficient.|It may limit the expression space of client.|We mainly summarized our thoughts and confusions and construct some critical questions regarding them. We also reserved some time for our client so that he can talk his advice freely.|
|       9/3/2021    |   Communication   |   Yuliang Ma, Jiawei Fan, Yuchen Wang, Kai: First offline gathering with our cilent            |  We met our client and discussed with him. He showed us some demo that contains the supposed outcomes of our porject and promised that we would get our specific working content after he consult with his company members.|We made our objectives clear and adequately understanded the content of our work. We can arrange our specific workload very soon based on the strength of our team members. We can construct our project preliminarily.|We still cannot make sure what our client suppose us to do. We may find the workload is much bigger than we imagined. We meet some challenge in arranging working content because of gaps among team members.|We all agreed that our goal is to develop an inteligent algorithm that can label the user's videos automatically for the Cinefly app so that it can construct a story for each video based on its content. We may do some research in advance, meanwhile we also refer to the samples provided by our client to develop a proper algorithm. We also need to make clear deliverable schedule ASAP|
|       9/3/2021    |   Technology   |   All: Basically form the direction and scope of our project       |  We generally understood the working content of our project and defined our early direction of working process.| We summarized client's answers towards our confusions and preliminarily evaluate the workload and next stage of our project, which is helpful to our division of work. | The conclusion we reached may have some deviation because of lack of detailed data and model from our client. There was also may a gap between its real scale and our supposed one.|We all agreed that our goal is to develop an intelligent algorithm that can label the user's videos automatically for the Cinefly app so that it can construct a story for each video based on its content. We may do some research in advance, meanwhile we also refer to the samples provided by our client to develop a proper algorithm. We also need to make clear deliverable schedule ASAP|
|       10/3/2021   |   Admin   |   All: Summarize feedback from the audit roughly           |  We experienced our first Audit and we performed our project description presentation during that. We received several useful feedback from our tutor and convenor, and we extract some critical suggestions and requirements we need to satisfy.|We made our repository more professional and learned the skills that can make our presentation more clearly.|Probable it may affect our early-stage working time schedule.|We decided to enrich the content in our repository by adding more standard project managing component. We will use more images and tables in the coming tutorials and audits.|
|       17/3/2021   |   Technology   |   Kai, all our members : Consider to start our working without specific data from our client|We still do not get the response from Kai. It is supposed that Kai would have offered some statistics(especially the labels of sample videos) regarding our algorithm. We have to move on.|We can keep our process following the schedule.  We can get more sufficient knowledge reserve before we start our work. We can arrange the working content based on our own preference and formulate the deliverable schedule more flexibly.|The final outcome may be affected because of the lack of standard statistics and reference. The product may not satisify our client's requirement entirely.|We are going to start work this weekend no matter whether we receive the response. But we will still keep communicating with our client and try to find another contact way except outlook. We will do some preliminary research to define team charters so that everyone in our team can focus on their components.|
|       19/3/2021   |   Admin   |   Tim, all: Fix our repository further                           |  According to the suggestions from Tim, we needed to add more details to some components of our repository. It included Risk analysis in the SOW, and we also needed to present risks and time line in our landing page. Besides, we need to transform the description in our landing page to the corresponding links in our repository in github.|We can make our repository as clear and systematic as possible so that our client, tutors and convenors can observe our progress and achievements clearly.|It adds more workload to our whole team. It may also slow down the whole progress.|We decided to follow Tim's advice and worked for it.|
|       21/3/2021   |   Technology   |   All: Determine to construct the algorithm based on our own research                    |  We found that we need to identify our project without any samples or demos. | We can better measure the scope and decide the macro direction of our project. | Some problems we cared about still need our client's thinking and deciding. We must start our work based on the general description in that email. | We recognized that we need to construct that algorithm on our own because so far we cannot get any formal examples or demos. However, we do have a reference page that can guide our technical direction so that we can basically determine how the outcome should be. 
|       21/3/2021   |   Communication   |   Kai, all: Made an appointment that declares the weekly meeting time with our client                   |  Kai replied our email and confirmed our weekly meeting time in his reply | We successfully got communication with our client and got the answers to our issues clearly. | We still need to face the risks that our client is too busy to attend our weekly meeting. We may need to prepare extra meeting topics in case of his absentation| We made appointment that includes the daily meeting schedule with our client, and it will contribute much to the communication between us and our client.  
|       25/3/2021   |   Admin   |   All: Start to prepare for our next Audit                  |   We determine the working content based on the requirements of next Audit and held an online meeting to complete the work together.| We will perform better in the coming audit and we will express the situation clearly.| It may take up much time of the whole team.| We held a zoom meeting and discuss each member's working content.|
|       29/3/2021   |   Technology  |    Jiawei Fan and Yuliang Ma: Determine the basic framework of our algorithm  |   2 of our members did some research and decided to adopt the OpenCV as the basic frame to handle the video input of our algorithm. | We have direction of research; We can arrange specific technical task for each member. | It may be not perfectly suitable, and we may still need to change the component of that frame if it is necessary. | We decided to follow that route for the moment after we held a short meeting.
|       7/4/2021    |   Admin       |    All: We received some feedback after audit 2 and we decided to held a meeting to select some useful suggestions and follow them. | We read the feedback item by item to choose good ones. We also summarized them and assign corresponding members to take care of them. | We can perfect our repository. | It may lead to homogenization when different porject repositories are compared. | We finally reached a critical consensus.
|       7/4/2021    |   Communication  | All: decided to improve our present skill, presentation pages and the content of elevator pitch. | We found a number of suggestions pointing out that we still need to improve our speech during our audit in terms of ppt materials and skills of presentation. | We can have better speech in the next audit and we will improve our speech skills for our future careers. | It may occupy us some time to fix and improve it, and it may slow down the technical progress of the project. | Each member was assigned with corresponding task to fix the shortcomings. 
|       7/4/2021    |   Admin       |    All: We are going to add some extra components to our repository based on the feedback.| We selected some reasonable advice from the portal. |  We take practice to reduce our drawbacks.| We may spend much time.| We decided to add user story with quality criteria to our repository; We will have the SOW document signed by our client; We will assign a dupty spokesman for our team; We will correct our grammar in our repository.
