| 2        |Prepare for the first audit and contact our client to identify our project clearly.| We emailed our client and made an appointment with him to discuss the topics regarding our project. However, we did not perform well in our second audit.|We did not use any practical skills in our presentation, in other words, we kept relying on text to express our thoughts or plans.| The convener and the tutor gave us many suggestions about our repository and pitch. We decided to fix them in the next days. |
| 3        |Clearly identify our project based the requirements from our client and start previous preparation work| Our client showed us the supposed functionality and outcome of our project, but we still lack detailed materials to start technical workload| We need some technical details to better determine the inner construction of our algorithm. However, we did not get proper code.| We may need to do some research independently so that the product can generally satisfy the requirements|
| 4        |Determine the weekly zoom meeting time with our client, and get some technical materials from our client if possible.| We successfully made an appointment with our client, but we only got a website that can roughly guide the direction and generally show the final outcome.| The algorighm we were going to develop is a new direction in current market so there is not many precedent that we can refer. | We need to identify the details of the algorithm on our own. 
| 5        |Prepare for the second audit and determine the technical details of our project; Make out character working content and deliverable schedule.|We had a good coordination and we spent about 4 hours together in preparing and exercising our speech together. | Most of our team members are conscientious. |Compared to audit 1, we believe that we will have a much better one.
| 6        |Give a clear speech in audit 2 and determine the technical route for our algorithm| We did a good job in our audit 2. We basically agreed with the technical framework that Jiawei Fan came up with.| Jiawei Fan, Yuliang Ma did some research and found a reasonable frame which may be suitable for our mission. Consider that we are not required to use specific construction or operator, we can adopt it. | We start to do corresponding research.
| 7        |Improve our project repository in line with the feedback in the techlaunch portal. | We held a short meeting to deal with that issue. And we successfully assign each member with a certain amount of task.| We found some useful advice and some existing drawbacks in our project. We decided to follow the suggestions. | We perfected our repository.
