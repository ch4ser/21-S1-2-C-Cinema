#### Date: 21rd Apr 2021


This is the agenda for week 9 tutorial, the team has dicussed the work done in week 3 and think of this agenda as a team. Followings
are several points which the team wants to dicuss with tutors and peers.

1.In the first meeting with the client, he promised to point out the research direction for us. We emailed the client last Friday and 
today to ask about his decision but did not get a response. 

2.If we still donâ€™t get a response next week, can we start our own research directly based on the information obtained from the first 
meeting with the client.

3.What can we do if the client is not satisfied with the results if he does not reply when we ask him about the details of the project?
